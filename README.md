<h1>Descrambler</h1>
<p>
  Just for fun wanted to combine a quick interest in art with a want to learn more about the multiprocessing library in python. 
  This program scrambles set pixels and then returns them to there original location scaling their intensity as they move. The best
  results come from a 1/x scale
</p>
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Better memory use
  </li>
  <li>
    More selection methods for pixels to be scrambled
  </li>
  <li>
    Possible GPU utilization
  </li>
</ul>
